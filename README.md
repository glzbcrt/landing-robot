# Robots

**master branch**
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/glzbcrt/robots.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/glzbcrt/robots)

Robots is a small application I wrote for an interview in Java. The task was simple, create an application to receive commands from the command line and after these commands were executed print the final position in a plane where the robot moved.

However I added some nice features like:

1. There is a graphical interface to watch the robots moving around;
2. There is both an interactive and a command line way to send the commands;
3. Ability to create several planets instead of only one;
4. Ability to land more than one robot in each planet.

This is more a showcase of my knowledge about Java, OOP and the stack of technologies than anything useful.
