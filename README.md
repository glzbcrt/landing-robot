# Robots

**master branch**
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/glzbcrt/robots.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/glzbcrt/robots)

Robots was a small application I wrote for an interview in Java. The task was simple, create an application to receive commands from command line and after these commands were executed print the position in a plane where the robot moved.

However I added some nice features like:

1. There is a graphical interface to watch the robots moving around;
2. There is both an interactive and a parametrized way to send the commands;
3. Ability to create several planets;
4. Ability to land more than one robot in each planet.

This is more a showcase of my knowledge about Java, OOP and the stack of technologies than anything useful.
